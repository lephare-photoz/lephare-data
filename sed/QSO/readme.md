# AGN templates and lists

This directory contains Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) and lists of those templates for computing photometric redshift for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). 

The SEDs are split between various folders according to the papers they were originally presented in.

## SEDs

The SED folders are:

- [synthetic] Synthetic templates
- [brown] Templates presented in Brown et al. ()
- [polleta] Templates presented in Poletta et al. ()
- [salvato] Templates presented in Salvato et al. (2009,2011,2017,2022)
- [miscellaneous] Various templates and other data that have been used historically.

## SED lists

The main lists which we recommend using that specify a given set of SEDs are

- salvato09.list
- salvato11.ext.list
- salvato11.plike.list
- ananna17.ext.list
- ananna17.plike.list


There are also many readmes, lists, and templates of varied origin that we wish to retain for legacy purposes. These are stored in the miscellaneous folder.
