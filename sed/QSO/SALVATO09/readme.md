# README for Salvato09 library

The determination of the photometric redshift for AGN is challenging, and the construction of the library of templates plays a strong role.
For AGN detected in X-ray, the selection of the templates is best performed by splitting the sample by their appearance in the optical images (point-like or extended) and by applying a different library and different priors and by their X-ray fluxes.
This library of templates has been used successfully in computing the photometric redshifts for the AGN detected in XMM-COSMOS and presented in Salvato et al. 2009.
The same library was used for the determination of the photometric redshifts for the sources in Chandra-COSMOS (Salvato et al 2011) and Legacy-Chandra COSMOS (Marchesi et al 2016).
More Libraries are available for surveys as deep as Lockman Hole (Fotopoulou et al 2012), CDFS ( Hsu et al 2014), STRIPE82X (Ananna et al 2017), eROSITA/eFEDS (Salvato et al 2024), in the appendix of those paper  or by requesting them to the first Authors.
